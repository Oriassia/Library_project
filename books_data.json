      "short_description": "The bilingual (Aramaic-Hebrew) concordance to the Targum of the Prophets is the product of an international project based in the Theological University of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, Kampen (ThUK) and supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). With this publication a major research tool becomes available to those engaged in Biblical and Jewish Studies. For the first time meaningful quotations from the Targum and the Masoretic Hebrew text of the Bible are set out in parallel so that the user of the concordance can study the translation technique of the Targum in much greater detail than was hitherto possible. The concordance opens up Targum Jonathan to scholars in various fields. It is an indispensable tool not only for research in the fields of textual criticism and the history of interpretation of the Hebrew Bible, but also for the study of early Judaism, the New Testament and patristics.To facilitate consultation on the basis of the Hebrew, every concordance per book contains a Hebrew-Aramaic index. The final volume will contain additions and corrections, a cumulative Aramaic-Hebrew index, as well as an English-Aramaic index.",
